# LandingPage
This is a simple example of a landing page using `HTML` and `CSS`. The Bussiness used to demonstrate was *Look Ópticas*, a store of optical glasses in Fortaleza/Ceará - Brasil.

##### The objective here is to learn the easiest functions of web pages
The webpage was made in Portuguese because it is a Brazilian store. :brazil:
It was our result.
